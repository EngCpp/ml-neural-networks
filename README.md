# ml-recommender-system

```Application that suggests 10 films based on the user's history```

The application uses the categories as parameters which doesn't give a lot of precision.. 

Adding more parameters like (year/decade of the film, views, likes and dislikes or even actors) could significantly improve the suggestions.
