# ml-recommender-system

```Application that suggests 10 films based on the user's preferences```

The application uses the categories as parameters which doesn't give a lot of precision.. 

Adding more parameters like (year/decade of the film, views, likes and dislikes or even actors) could significantly improve the suggestions.

To compile: ```mvn clean package install```
To run: ```java -jar ./target/ml-recommender-1.0.jar``` or ```./remote-debug.sh```
